* Using the company's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement, the task involves projecting free cash flows, calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for discounting future cash flows, determining the terminal value, and discounting both free cash flows and terminal value to present value.

> **Overview of the steps:**
* Forecasting Cash Flows:

* Terminal Value Determination:
Compute the terminal value, representing the company's worth beyond the forecast period. This value is a critical component in the valuation process.
